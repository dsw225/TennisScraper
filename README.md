# TennisScraper

I created this basic scraper for my ATP & WTA Tennis Prediction Model. Currently, the Prediction Repository is private due to accidental file exposure which I'm fixing.

This scraper extracts games, odds, and stats from SofaScore using proxies and saves them to a CSV file. To ensure accurate data retrieval and prevent flagging, each connection's keepalive is disabled, resulting in slower operation.

Please note: You must provide your own proxies for it to function properly.
